fast execution 
go is compiled like c, rust 
python, js, ruby is interpreted 
java and c# are vm based
go consume much less memory then java 
go is even faster then java and c, rust in terms of running a code and code compilation at production level
if we create a go.exe file anyone can run that exe file without installing go on their device
in go it do err checking then compiling then execute/ run and give result all at the same time
go build create an binary which is directly machine understandable without any interpreter
rust/c have manual memory management, java have garbage collector and it need jvm, go have garbage collector automated
go/ rust use very less memory and java use 100time more while execution as jvm also took some
